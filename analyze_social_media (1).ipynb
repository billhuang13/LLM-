You will do this by reading comments from Reddit and YouTube and asking the LLM how the commenter feels about your candidate and topics of interest. We will run the provided code (with your modifications) code each day to get a picture of the public's opinion on your candidate and issues and how it changes all the way to November 5, election day!\n",
